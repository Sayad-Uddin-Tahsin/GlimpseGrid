## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Before reporting, please review the following guidelines:

- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and address it.
- Do not perform any destructive testing, such as testing on live production systems or using automated vulnerability scanning tools.
- Provide as much detail as possible in your report, including a clear description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.

We will acknowledge your report within 24 - 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for when we expect to have the vulnerability fixed. We will also keep you updated as we work to address the issue.
